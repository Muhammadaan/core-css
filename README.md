# [Core](http://corecss.io)
Core is a lightweight foundation for building responsive websites. It weighs in at only about 1.3kb, minified and gzipped. There are no pre-styled elements or animations built-in â€“ just a reset and a grid system. This is a framework for people who don't need all the features of larger frameworks and just want to build systematically from the ground up.
